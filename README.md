# Ball-Interceptor
None of the enviromental variables are known(such as gravity, resistance, mass and velocity), input is the video of 10 frames long, after that we use newton's shooting method to find the variables and recover the curve using RK4 and ball motion ODE

user input the shooting position and the intercept position, for in depth analysis of the algorithm and program see the paper
